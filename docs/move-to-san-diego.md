# Move to San Diego

We suggest moving to San Diego around early September so you have some time to settle in and get to know the area!

## On-campus housing

UCSD Housing Dining Hospitality (HDH) operates [Graduate and Family Housing](https://hdhgradfamilyhousing.ucsd.edu/), a set of on-campus housing for full-time graduate and professional students as well as married students and students with families. As a full-time gradaute student, you are eligible for a **two-year fixed-term housing agreement**. You can find more information on the [Graduate and Family Housing Future Residents FAQ page](https://hdhgradfamilyhousing.ucsd.edu/faq/future-residents.html#Questions-about-Living-at-UC-Sa).

If you are planning to live on-campus, we recommend applying to the graduate housing waitlist **immediately** because graduate housing is highly competitive. We also suggest to indicate your estimated arrival date to be a **month to a month-and-a-half earlier** than your actual arrival date to have higher priority on the waitlist. If your arrival date is approaching and you haven't heard back, we suggest calling the [Graduate and Family Housing Allocations office](https://hdhgradfamilyhousing.ucsd.edu/about-us/contact-us.html). If you haven't heard back by mid-August, we recommend you begin looking for off-campus options.

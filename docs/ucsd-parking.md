# Parking at UCSD

Like at any college campus, parking can be an adventure and is not free. Included here is where to park for bootcamp and a few options on how to pay for parking.

## Parking during bootcamp

The two closest parking structures to the Medical Education and Telemedicine (MET) building are [Osler](https://goo.gl/maps/uzz2HEvGEtH3rYE19) and [Gilman](https://goo.gl/maps/Cv84DpaKnMcgr7Th9) parking structures. 

With the graduate student parking pass or the daily parking pass with the Park Mobile app, you can park in any **B** spot!

## Parking Passes

10 day or Consecutive Day (30-365 days) permit. The Consecutive Day permit replaces legacy monthly, quarterly and annual options. You can purchase these permits [here](https://ucsd-transportation.t2hosted.com/Account/Portal).  

## Daily Parking

To pay for a daily graduate student permit, sign up for the [Park Mobile](https://transportation.ucsd.edu/commute/pay-by-app.html) app **with your ucsd email!** To get the graduate student rate ($5.35/day), type the zone code '47300' into the 'Search Zones' bar (Save this code as a favorite!). The app should show you '01:00' days. If it does not show you $5.35 for a single day pass, please contact UCSD parking and request your account to be labeled as a 'graduate student'. 

## Free ways to get to campus during the quarter

The trolley is free for students (during the quarter) by obtaining a U-Pass through the [Pronto app](https://transportation.ucsd.edu/commute/transit/index.html). Parking at trolley stops is free (but limited) and then riding the train is free!

[UCSD's transportation and parking info for graduate students page](https://transportation.ucsd.edu/commute/grad-students.html) provides information on the Triton U-Pass program for public transit access, carpools options, parking permits, cycling benefits, and more.

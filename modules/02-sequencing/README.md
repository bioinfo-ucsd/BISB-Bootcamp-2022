# Module 2: Introduction to Sequencing

To get started run the setup script from your home directory:

```bash
bash ~/public/BISB-Bootcamp-2022/modules/02-sequencing/student_setup.sh 
```

This will create a directory called `bootcamp-02-sequencing` in your home directory and link the necessary data with the following structure. Since some of these files are large, we link them from a shared directory instead of copying them.

```bash
bootcamp-02-sequencing
├── 01-whole-exome # activity 1
└── 02-whole-genome # activity 2
```

# Module 2: Introduction to Sequencing

<!-- TODO: copy this content into first slide -->

To get started run the setup script from your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
bash ~/public/02-sequencing/student_setup.sh 
```

This will create a directory called `bootcamp-02-sequencing` in your home directory and link the necessary data with the following structure. Since some of these files are large, we link them from a shared directory instead of copying them.

```bash
bootcamp-02-sequencing
├── 01-whole-exome # activity 1
├── 02-whole-genome # activity 2
├── 03-rna-seq # activity 3
├── jbrowse2 # jbrowse2 installation 
```

<!-- TODO: add jbrowse startup -->

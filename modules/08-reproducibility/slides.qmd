## What is reproducibility? {.smaller}

The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) subcommittee on replicability defines **reproducibility** as:

>the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator.

::: {.fragment}
>That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results.... 
:::
::: {.fragment}
>Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative.

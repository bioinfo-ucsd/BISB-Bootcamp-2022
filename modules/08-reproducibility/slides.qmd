## What is reproducibility? {.smaller}

The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) subcommittee on replicability defines **reproducibility** as 

<blockquote>"the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the **same materials** as were used by the original investigator.<span class="fragment">  That is, a second researcher might use the **same raw data** to build the **same analysis files** and implement the **same statistical analysis** in an attempt to yield the **same results**..."</span></blockquote>

<span class="fragment">This is distinct from **replicability**, defined by the NSF as</span>

<blockquote class="fragment">"the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but **new data are collected**."</blockquote>

<span class="fragment">While replicability is important,</span> <blockquote class="fragment" style="color:blue">**Reproducibility** is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative.</blockquote>

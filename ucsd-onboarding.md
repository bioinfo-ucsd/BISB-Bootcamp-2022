# UC San Diego Onboarding

## Setup your UCSD email

You may have already received information on how to set up and log into your UCSD email account. This information would have been sent via email to the email address you listed on your graduate application.

Set up instructions can be found at this [link](https://support.ucsd.edu/its?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0033344&sys_kb_id=895a32351b9e4d50506f64e8624bcb02).

Emails from Bootcamp Instructors, as well as future emails from BISB will be sent to your @ucsd email.

## Enroll in Fall courses

The Schedule of Classes, which lists courses available for the quarter, for Fall 2022 will be made available on Tuesday, May 17th.

You can find the Schedule of Classes, along with other important services, on the [My TritonLink Tools page](https://students.ucsd.edu/my-tritonlink/tools/index.html). You will be able to enroll in classes beginning Friday, May 20th, at 8:00 AM PT.

You may enroll in courses online using WebReg, whichc an also be found on My TritonLink Tools. You can find enrollment dates, and many other important dates and deadlines, on the [UCSD Enrollment & Registration Calendar](https://students.ucsd.edu/academics/enroll/calendar22-23.html). We highly recommended you bookmark this page to stay up-to-date on important deadlines.

*NOTE: Registration can always be changed later, and more advice on courses will be relayed during Bootcamp. As such, it is not urgently required that you enroll in classes asap. In addition, many courses – particularly MED BMI courses – are not listed on WebReg until closer to the start of the Fall quarter.*

Course requirements can be found on the BISB [website](https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/node/104).

## Obtain your Campus ID card

As a graduate student, you should make sure to obtain a [UCSD Campus ID Card](https://students.ucsd.edu/finances/campus-cards/index.html). You can find information about how to get your first ID card on the [UCSD Campus Card Office website](https://sfs.ucsd.edu/campus-cards/your-student-id.html).

In order to obtain your ID card, you will need to provide a picture (instructions at the above link) and then pick up your ID card from the Campus Card Office when you arrive on campus. 

BISB will not be distributing cards, so you must pick up the ID card directly from the Campus Card Office yourself. You will need to provide your campus ID card at the Graduate Division Resource Fair in September, so you should plan to pick up your ID card before then.

## International Students & Programs Office (ISPO)

If you are an international student and have questions about your visa, CPT, OPT, etc., we encourage you to speak with ISPO as they are the visa experts on campus. You can find their contact information on [their website](https://ispo.ucsd.edu/contact/index.html).

## Additional Questions

If you have additional questions on academics, funding, or other aspects of BISB, our graduate program coordinator has graciously alloted time for special 1:1 advising. These sessions are not mandatory. If you are interested in this, feel free to schedule a meeting via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/fperezestrada/bisb-office-hours).

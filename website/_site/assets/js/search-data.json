If you are planning to live on-campus, we recommend applying to the graduate housing waitlist immediately because graduate housing is highly competitive. We also suggest to indicate your estimated arrival date to be a month to a month-and-a-half earlier than your actual arrival date to have higher priority on the waitlist. If your arrival date is approaching and you haven’t heard back, we suggest calling the Graduate and Family Housing Allocations office. If you haven’t heard back by mid-August, we recommend you begin looking for off-campus options. ",

You may enroll in courses online using WebReg, which can also be found on My TritonLink Tools. You can find enrollment dates, and many other important dates and deadlines, on the UCSD Enrollment &amp; Registration Calendar. We highly recommended you bookmark this page to stay up-to-date on important deadlines. NOTE: Registration can always be changed later. As such, it is not urgently required that you enroll in classes. That being said, Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) courses tend to fill up quickly, so we suggest starting to explore these. If a CSE course of interest is full, many students have found success in emailing the professor. In addition, many courses – particularly MED BMI courses – are not listed on WebReg until closer to the start of the Fall quarter. More advice on courses will be relayed during Bootcamp.

# Bootcamp COVID-19 Policies and Procedures

To attend Bootcamp in person, we need to follow the policies set by UCSD for in-person meetings.

Before attending, we ask that all students complete the following:

1. Covid test (PCR or Antigen) < 7 days before bootcamp (Free testing details below)
2. Every morning, complete the [Student Symptom Screening](https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/campus-guidelines/testing-and-screening/student-screening-and-testing/index.html) and show your "Green Thumb" at check-in.

## Free Covid Testing at UCSD

All information related to free covid testing can be found on the [Student Health Covid website](https://studenthealth.ucsd.edu/appointments/covid.html) and the [Return to Learn Testing and Screening page](https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/campus-guidelines/testing-and-screening/index.html).

Below are some suggestions from Bootcamp instructors.

- **Once you have your student ID**, you will have access to the self-testing [vending machines](https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/campus-guidelines/testing-and-screening/index.html#Vending-machine-locations) around campus and student housing. This is the most accesible method (24/7) but can take >24 hrs depending on when you dropped off your sample.
- **Before you have a student ID**, you can make appointments for [asymptomatic testing](https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/campus-guidelines/testing-and-screening/student-screening-and-testing/index.html#Make-an-Appointment-for-Provide) at the Price Center or at 9331 Athena Circle in La Jolla through the [UCSD COVID19 Test Scheduler](https://covid19testing.ucsd.edu/?Symptom=asymptom&Location=campus). We suggest making an appointment ASAP for any time beteween 9/6/22 - 9/10/22 to ensure you recieve results on time.

## Antigen Testing

- If you recently had a COVID-19 infection (<90 days), please take a home antigen test before attending. There may be ways to get reimbursed for tests through your insurance.

## Green Thumb

UCSD campus policy requires every individual who comes to campus to complete the daily [Student Symptom Screening](https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/campus-guidelines/testing-and-screening/student-screening-and-testing/index.html). Only if the screening shows a Green or Yellow thumb will you be allowed to attend Bootcamp in-person.

If after answering the screening questions you have a yellow thumb, you will be required to mask indoors and outdoors and we will have you eat outside.

If you have a red thumb, UCSD Health Testing Support Line will call you or you can call them (619-543-8260). Please email/discord message/text the bootcamp instructors and we will provide zoom links to participate remotely if you are feeling up to attending.

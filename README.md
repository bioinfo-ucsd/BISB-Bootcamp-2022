# Bioinformatics & Systems Biology (BISB) Bootcamp 2022

Welcome to the 2022 Bootcamp for incoming students to the UC San Diego Bioinformatics & Systems Biology (BISB) PhD program!

This 5-day intensive course is designed to place incoming PhD students on a path to success in their doctoral studies by conducting the following:

- Introduce the doctoral program, the UC San Diego, and the greater San Diego area
- Foster community among students of the incoming cohort and with senior students
- Convey expectations for the core curriculum and elective courses, while reviewing basic concepts
- Showcase faculty research and guide students in preparing for their research rotations
- Review strategies for choosing an advisor, navigating a PhD, and preparing for a scientific career

Bootcamp's content spans the topics listed above and is delivered through lectures, discussions, and interactive modules.

## Location and Schedule

Bootcamp is held in the week prior to the start of Fall classes, from **Monday, September 12, 2022 to Friday, September 16, 2022**, in **[MET](https://goo.gl/maps/eXQLH5v2zcRU8f8P8) room 141**. See the [Schedule Overview](schedule-overview.md) and [Schedule Details](schedule-details.md). *Please note the schedule is actively being developed and is subject to change.*

## Learn about BISB/BMI Research: Summer Faculty Talks

Over the summer, prior to Bootcamp, we host a weekly seminar series via Zoom where BISB and BMI faculty share their work and incoming students can learn about research opportunities. To learn more about the series, see [Summer Faculty Talks](summer-faculty-talks.md).

## Moving to San Diego

We suggest moving to San Diego in **early September** so you have some time to settle in and get to know the area. See [Move to San Diego](move-to-san-diego.md) for more information.

## Course Instructors

This course is led by current BISB graduate students! Four lead instructors curate Bootcamp's content and teach the majority of lectures, while guest instructors are invited to provide instruction on specialized topics. See [People](people.md) for more information.

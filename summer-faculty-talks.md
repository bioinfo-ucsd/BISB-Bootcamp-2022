# Summer Faculty Talk Series

Each summer, we host a series of faculty talks intended to be a forum for faculty to share their research and for incoming students to learn about the research opportunities available to them.

Seminars take place each **Thursday from 12:00 PM PT to 1:00 PM PT over Zoom, from June 23rd to September 8th**. Each session will host two faculty members, where they will present their research in 20-25 minute and answer 5-10 minutes of guided Q&A. The BISB graduate program coordinator will notify the BISB Program mailing list in the days ahead of each seminar, including information about the presenters and a password-protected link to the Zoom meeting.

If you are unable to attend a seminar or you would like to rewatch a talk, you can find a collection of recordings in this [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BaqHq60zZ0wQcVU1gMukLwtHzxmWPSF3?usp=sharing).
